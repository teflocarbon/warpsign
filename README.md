## üéØ Based on SignTools-CI

This project is based on the fantastic [SignTools-CI](https://github.com/SignTools/SignTools-CI) by ViRb3. Without his work, this project would not have been possible. Many thanks! üôè

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Paid Apple Developer Account**. Free accounts will never be supported.
- Apple Developer or Distribution Certificate (generated via Developer Portal)
- Python 3.10 or higher
- macOS (Apple signing requirements)

> [!WARNING]
> Wildcard provisioning profiles and identifiers are not supported

## üíª System Requirements

### Local Signing

- macOS 11.0 or later (required for code signing)
- Command Line Tools for Xcode (run `xcode-select --install`)
- ldid (run `brew install ldid-procursus`)
- At least 1GB free disk space for temporary files
- Active internet connection for Developer Portal API access

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whilst every attempt has been made throughout the script to limit the impact to your system, there is still modification of system resources such as the keychain. If you do not wish to have any such impact on your system, it's recommended to use the CI version.

### CI Signing

- Any operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Active internet connection
- GitHub account with repository access

> [!WARNING]
> **GitHub Actions Minutes Usage**: WarpSign CI uses macOS runners which consume 10x more minutes than Linux runners. Free and Pro GitHub accounts have limited monthly minutes. Typically, a signing job with litterbox will take 1-2 minutes (counting as 10-20 minutes against your quota). Using croc can vary based on your connection speed and may use more minutes. [Check GitHub's billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for more information on minute allocations.
>
> **Public Repository Note**: GitHub Actions usage is free for standard GitHub-hosted runners in public repositories. However, making your repository public exposes sensitive information in the workflow logs (like your Apple Developer name and Team ID) and may violate GitHub's terms of service for this use case. Use public repositories at your own risk.

## üì¶ Installation

### Install pipx

First, install pipx which is used to install and run Python applications in isolated environments:

See the [pipx installation guide](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#install-pipx) here.

### Install or Update WarpSign

```bash
pipx install --force https://github.com/teflocarbon/warpsign/archive/main.zip
```

For automated environments or advanced users:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall https://github.com/teflocarbon/warpsign/archive/main.zip
```

## üîê Setup Wizard

The easiest way to set up WarpSign is to use the built-in setup wizard:

```bash
warpsign setup
```

This interactive wizard will guide you through:

- Uploading your development and distribution certificates
- Setting up your Apple ID credentials
- Configuring GitHub CI settings (if needed)
- Creating your configuration file

## üìù Advanced Configuration

For advanced users who prefer manual configuration:

1. WarpSign stores configuration in `~/.warpsign/` directory
2. Sample configuration file is available at `warpsign/src/constants/config.toml.sample`
3. Certificates should be placed in:
   ```
   ~/.warpsign/certificates/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cert.p12
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cert_pass.txt
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ distribution/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cert.p12
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cert_pass.txt
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> You must have a password with your certificate.

## üîë Session Management

WarpSign stores authentication sessions in `~/.warpsign/sessions/` to avoid repeated login prompts. To force re-authentication, delete this directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.warpsign/sessions
```

## üöÄ Usage

Get help and see available options:

```bash
warpsign --help
```

Basic signing:

```bash
warpsign sign my-app.ipa
```

### CI Usage

1. Fork or use the template [warpsign-ci](https://github.com/teflocarbon/warpsign-ci). Make sure workflows are enabled under the Actions tab.

> [!WARNING]
> It's recommended to use a template rather than a fork, since a fork must be public and cannot be made private. The logs will output things like your Team ID and your name as an Apple Developer.

2. Set up your CI configuration using the setup wizard:

```bash
warpsign setup --ci
```

3. Run the CI signing:

```bash
warpsign sign-ci my-app.ipa
```

#### Upload Providers

WarpSign supports two upload providers for CI signing. You can specify your preferred provider using `--upload-provider`:

| Provider                | Description                      | Pros                                                                                        | Cons                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **litterbox** (default) | Third-party file sharing service | ‚Ä¢ Minimizes GitHub Actions runner time<br>‚Ä¢ Better for slower connections<br>‚Ä¢ Simple setup | ‚Ä¢ 1GB file size limit<br>‚Ä¢ Files stored on third-party server                                                                  |
| **croc**                | P2P secure file transfer         | ‚Ä¢ No file size limit<br>‚Ä¢ More private (direct P2P transfer)<br>‚Ä¢ End-to-end encryption     | ‚Ä¢ Requires fast, stable connection<br>‚Ä¢ May use more GitHub Actions minutes<br>‚Ä¢ May not work depending on network environment |

```bash
# Use croc for P2P file transfer
warpsign sign-ci my-app.ipa --upload-provider croc
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Carefully consider these options based on your connection speed, file size, and privacy requirements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's recommended to use a `Fine-grained personal access token` from GitHub. You only need to enable Read/write access on Secret and Actions. If you don't know how to create a token, please read the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

## Examples

Show all available options:

```bash
warpsign sign --help
```

Enable debug mode (requires development certificate):

```bash
warpsign sign my-app.ipa --patch-debug
```

Force original bundle ID for push notifications (requires distribution certificate):

```bash
warpsign sign my-app.ipa --force-original-id
```

Enable file sharing and promotion support:

```bash
warpsign sign my-app.ipa --patch-file-sharing --patch-promotion
```

## üö® Common Issues

- **Certificate Errors**: Try re-create your certificate, make sure it's exported with the private key.
- **Authentication Failed**: Check your Apple ID credentials and ensure 2FA is handled properly
- **Signing Failed**: Verify certificate passwords and ensure they haven't expired
- **Push Notifications**: Use `--force-original-id` with distribution certificates for push support
